/// Implementations write a per-batch matches mask into the caller-provided

/// NULL rows are always excluded ("definitely matches" semantics) so word-wise
/// AND across columns is equivalent to SQL three-valued conjunction.
///
/// The matcher overwrites `outWords` in full — the caller does not need to
/// clear it beforehand. `outWords.length` must be at least
/// `(batch.recordCount + 63) >>> 6`.
