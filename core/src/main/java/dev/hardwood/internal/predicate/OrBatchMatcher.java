/// Composes two [ColumnBatchMatcher]s evaluated against the same column and
/// word-OR merges their bit masks. Used when an eligible subtree has multiple
/// leaves on a single column joined by `Or` (e.g. `id < -5 OR id > 5`).
///
/// Under the "definitely matches, nulls excluded" semantics of
/// [ColumnBatchMatcher], a bitwise OR across leaves is equivalent to SQL
/// three-valued disjunction: a row survives iff at least one leaf definitely
/// matches it.
///
/// Both children must be valid matchers for the column's batch — the composite
/// is type-agnostic and delegates the `batch.values` cast to each child. The
/// scratch buffer is allocated lazily on the first [#test] call and reused
/// across batches; the matcher is intended to be called sequentially by a
/// single drain thread.
